lpod-python
===========

Python library implementing the ISO/IEC 26300 OpenDocument Format standard.

This library is the python implementation of the lpOD Project (Languages &
Platforms OpenDocument, definition of a Free Software API implementing the
ISO/IEC 26300 standard).


This branch is the 'legacy' branch, aiming to be the next stable version.

If you don't have code using old Lpod version, you *should* use 'current'


Maintained branches are:

    - legacy  : compatible with 0.9x versions
    - current : next stable version
    - master  : currently, master = legacy
